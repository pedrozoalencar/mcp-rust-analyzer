# MCP Rust Analyzer - Release Notes

## Version 0.1.0

### Features Implemented

#### ✅ Core Infrastructure
- MCP server with JSON-RPC communication
- LSP client for rust-analyzer integration  
- Async command handling with Tokio
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

#### ✅ Code Analysis Commands
- `get_hover` - Get type information and documentation (LSP integrated)
- `find_references` - Find all references to a symbol (LSP integrated)
- `analyze_symbol` - Analyze a symbol across the project (pending full implementation)
- `get_diagnostics` - Get compiler errors and warnings (pending LSP notifications)
- `find_implementations` - Find trait implementations (pending LSP support)

#### ✅ Auto-complete Commands  
- `complete` - Get code completions at position (LSP integrated)
- `signature_help` - Get function/method signatures (pending LSP implementation)
- `get_completions` - Context-based completions (stub implementation)
- `resolve_import` - Suggest imports for symbols (stub implementation)
- `expand_snippet` - Expand code snippets (implemented with templates)

#### ✅ Refactoring Commands
- `rename` - Rename symbols across project (LSP integrated for position-based)
- `extract_function` - Extract code to function (pending LSP code actions)
- `inline` - Inline variables/functions (pending LSP code actions)
- `organize_imports` - Organize and sort imports (pending LSP code actions)

#### ✅ Metrics Commands
- `project_structure` - Analyze project module structure (fully implemented)
- `analyze_dependencies` - Parse and display dependencies (implemented)
- `code_metrics` - Calculate LOC, functions, structs, etc (fully implemented)
- `find_dead_code` - Detect unused code (pending LSP diagnostics)
- `suggest_improvements` - Code improvement suggestions (basic implementation)

### Technical Implementation

1. **Dual Mode Operation**:
   - Stub mode for testing without rust-analyzer
   - LSP mode with full rust-analyzer integration (USE_LSP=true)

2. **Process Management**:
   - Spawns and manages rust-analyzer subprocess
   - Implements proper LSP initialization handshake
   - Handles stdin/stdout communication with headers

3. **Async Architecture**:
   - Non-blocking command execution
   - Concurrent request handling
   - Timeout protection for LSP requests

### Current Limitations

1. **Partial LSP Integration**: 
   - Hover, completions, references, and rename are integrated
   - Code actions, diagnostics streaming not yet implemented

2. **Symbol Search**:
   - Symbol-based operations need workspace-wide search
   - Currently limited to position-based operations

3. **Refactoring Support**:
   - Basic rename works via LSP
   - Advanced refactorings need code action support

### Installation & Usage

```bash
# Install
./install.sh

# Or manual installation
cargo build --release
cp target/release/mcp-rust-analyzer ~/.local/bin/

# Configure Claude Code (automatic with install.sh)
# See mcp-config.json for configuration details
```

### Testing

Comprehensive test suite covering:
- Server message handling
- Command routing
- LSP client communication  
- Individual command handlers
- Integration tests

Run tests with: `cargo test`

### Future Roadmap

1. **Complete LSP Integration**:
   - Implement textDocument/codeAction for refactorings
   - Add diagnostics notification handling
   - Support workspace/symbol for project-wide search

2. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Streaming diagnostics as you type
   - Quick fixes and code actions
   - Multi-file refactoring support
   - Semantic token highlighting info

3. **Performance**:
   - Request caching for repeated queries
   - Batch operation support
   - Connection pooling for multiple rust-analyzer instances

### Contributing

This project follows strict TDD practices:
1. Write tests first
2. Implement features
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Update documentation
5. Commit with descriptive messages
